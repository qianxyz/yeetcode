# Yeetcode

Why leetcode, if you can write your own?

## Objectives

- Decoupling solutions (frontend) and tests (backend)
- Frontend: Just fill in a function in a template file,
  which contains nothing but said function, just like Leetcode
- Backend: Organize test cases and driver code with auto-generated YAML;
  Manage the problem set modularly

## Roadmap

- [x] Create a minimal proof of concept
- [x] Solution files auto-generation
- [x] Subcommand to list problems and add new ones
- [ ] Data structures serde
- [ ] Multiple methods test routine
- [ ] CI checking the problem set integrity
