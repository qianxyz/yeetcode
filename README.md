Why leetcode, if you can write your own?

## Features

- Create problems and test cases with declarative YAML files,
  without writing python-specific setups or `assert` statements
- Fill in your solution into an auto-generated template Python file,
  which contains nothing but your solutions (just like leetcode)

## Quick start

Under construction. See you later!

## Roadmap

- [x] Create a minimal proof of concept
- [x] Solution files auto-generation
- [x] Subcommand to list problems and add new ones
- [x] Multiple methods test routine
- [ ] CI checking the problem set
- [ ] Data structures serde
- [ ] Prettify user messages
