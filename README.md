# Yeetcode

Why leetcode, if you can write your own?

## Objectives

- Decoupling solutions (frontend) and tests (backend)
- Frontend: Just fill in a function in a template file,
  which contains nothing but said funtion, just like Leetcode
- Backend: Organize test cases and driver code with auto-generated YAML;
  Manage the problem set modularly

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create a minimal proof of concept
